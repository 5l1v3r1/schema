# Schema

Schema is a modern, web-based database management tool. Features include:

- Modern UI and markup
- All AJAX
- Persistent database connections
- Support for MySQL (and eventually PostgreSQL and Mongo)

## Installation

To install, first you must download a copy of the source code. The best way to
do this would be using git:

    git clone git@github.com:timdavies/schema.git

However, you may prefer to download a ZIP archive of the source instead.
You can find this here: https://github.com/timdavies/schema/archive/master.zip

Once you have a copy of the source, enter the project directory and run the
following commands:

    npm install
    bower install

You will need to have `npm` and `bower` installed for this to work.

Finally, to run Schema, enter the following command:

    node app.js

Schema will now be running and you can access it by visiting `http://localhost:8000/`
in your browser.

Thanks for trying Schema!

## Development

I will add information about the source code and an overview of how it works
soon on the Github wiki. In the meantime, feel free to take a look at the source
and contribute any pull requests - they will be very welcome.

I am especially interested in having a designer come up with a nicer theme,
a UX expert take a look at how the UI could be improved and any advice or
pull requests from web developers with tips on how the markup could be improved.

Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you can advise.
